# L3T12-Capstone-II
Data science bootcamp final capstone project 

Description:
This project aims to analyze the US Arrests dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. The dataset contains statistics on assault, murder, rape, and urban population in each of the 50 US states in 1973.

The project involves the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed by checking for missing values and standardizing the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Histograms and a correlation heatmap are plotted to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
PCA: PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and capture the most important information. The explained variance ratio is analyzed to determine the optimal number of principal components.
Clustering: Two clustering techniques, K-means and Agglomerative clustering, are applied to group the states based on the standardized features. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method.
Cluster Analysis: The clusters are visualized using scatter plots, and cluster characteristics are analyzed by calculating the mean values for each cluster.
Dendrograms: Dendrograms are plotted to visualize the hierarchical clustering process and help interpret the results.
The project code and analysis are shared in this repository, providing a comprehensive overview of the data analysis process and insights obtained from the US Arrests dataset.
